	<h2>The ultimate croissant sandwich is this oven-toasted croissant with melted Havarti cheese, deli ham, fresh arugula, and a light honey Dijon dressing.</h2>
	<p>The easiest summer lunch can also be the most delicious—simply pick up some bakery-fresh croissants 
	and follow this recipe. Pack your sandwiches in a picnic basket along with the watermelon salad 
	above and bask in the sun. The bonus here is that these are easily customizable as well.</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>2 large croissants, split</li>
		<li>6 slices deli ham (such as Boar’s Head®)</li>
		<li>4 (3/4 ounce) slices Havarti cheese</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
		<li>1 cup loosely packed baby arugula</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil; set aside.</li>
		<li>Place bottom of each croissant, cut side up, on a baking sheet. Layer 3 of the ham slices and 2 of the Havarti slices over each croissant bottom.</li>
		<li>Whisk together olive oil, Dijon, and honey in a small mixing bowl until fully combined. Evenly brush top half of each croissant with about 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil mixture. Place top of each croissant, cut side down, on prepared baking sheet.</li>
		<li>Bake in the preheated oven until Havarti is melted and ham is heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, toss arugula and remaining olive oil mixture in a medium bowl until evenly coated. Remove croissants from oven. Top melted Havarti layer evenly with dressed arugula and croissant tops. Serve immediately.</li>
